# HMA-Glaciers-and-Overdeepenings-Data
HMA data for climate, physical geology, glacier, and overdeepening analysis.

Description of all folders and directories:

1.) <_Data_> folder includes shapfiles of the total and large overdeepenings calculated by (Furian, W., Loibl, D., & Schneider, C. (2021). Future glacial lakes in High Mountain Asia: An inventory and assessment of hazard potential from surrounding slopes. Journal of Glaciology, 1-18. doi:10.1017/jog.2021.18.)

2.) <HMA ERA5 Land> data of total precipitation and temperature at 2m. This was averaged over a 31-year period from 1981-2021.

3.) <HMA Glacial Centroids CSV> includes data of glacier centroids. This data includes the respective ERA5-Land temp and precip, as well as whether or not the specific glacier has an overdeepening. If a glacier has an overdeepening than the _OD_Large_ and _OD_ALL_ will have a 1, binarically. _OD_Large_ and _OD_ALl_ correspond to whether the glacier has a corresponding overdeepening from Furian's total overdeepening or large overdeepenings shapfiles. 

4.) <HMA Randolph Glacier Shapefiles> are not included because the files are too large for github. If needed, I will send you the subset of the glaciers over a cloud system
